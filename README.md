# Memory-Card-Game

The memory game is a common children's game played with a set of cards. The cards have a pictures on one side and each picture appears on two cards. The game starts with all the cards face down and players take turns to turn over two cards. If the two cards have the same picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards face down again. When the score reaches 80 if the click count is below 30 it says "EXCELLENT!!!" If it is between 30 and 50, it says "NOT BAD :)" and subtracts -30 points, if it is above 50 it says "TRY AGAIN :(" and subtracts -80 points. When you want to restart the game, you have to press the restart button. The locations of the images change randomly at the start of each game.
